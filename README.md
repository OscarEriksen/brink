# Brink
Brink is a better Bootstrap 4 workflow for Laravel.

It's basically the workflow from [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) by roots.

Also, this is my first ever Laravel package, so there's probably something I could have done differently.  
Please open an issue or a pull request if you have anything to add.

## Installation
To install Brink use the command: `php artisan brink`

If a file called `app.scss` already exists you will be asked to confirm because it will overwrite your current files.
You can also use the `--force` option to force the installation without any confirmation.
